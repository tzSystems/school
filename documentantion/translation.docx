Documentation for the Task
Objective:

Implement language translation for the remaining 30 pages in the system.
Current Implementation:

The translation is handled using index-based arrays in a language configuration file (lang/homePage.js).

Example format:

{
    "welcome": ["Welcome to", "Karibu Kwenye"],
    "school_management": ["School Management", "Mfumo wa Kusimamia"],
    "system": ["System", "Shughuli za Shule"]
}
You will find this in config/lang/homePage.js

Steps for the Task:

Review Existing Implementation:

1. Review the lang/homePage.js file to understand how the translation is handled.
Ensure consistency in the translation keys across different pages.
Create Language Files:

2. For each of the remaining pages, create a corresponding language file (lang/pageName.js).
Populate the arrays with translations for both languages.
Update React Components:

3. Import the newly created language files into the corresponding components.
Use the useSelector hook to get the current language code and apply translations using the index-based array.
Ensure that all text content in the component is translated.
Testing:

4. After implementing the translations, test each page by switching between languages to ensure that all text is correctly translated.
Look for any untranslated strings or errors.

Code Review:
Submit the updated files for a code review to ensure quality and consistency.

Time Estimate
Page Analysis (1 hour): Analyze the complexity of the pages and determine the average number of strings per page.
Translation Setup per Page (1-2 hours per page): Depending on the complexity and number of strings, translating and testing each page could take 1-2 hours.

Overall Time Estimate:
For 30 pages, the total time could range from 30 to 60 hours.
If working full-time (8 hours/day), it could take approximately 4 to 8 days to complete.

Additional Considerations
Team Member Skill Level: If the team member is experienced with the system, they may complete the task faster. If they need to familiarize themselves, additional time might be required.
Complex Pages: Some pages may have more content, dynamic text, or require additional logic, which could extend the time needed.
