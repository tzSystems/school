Overview
The School Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and enhance the management of educational institutions. The application offers various functionalities tailored to the needs of different user roles: Students, Teachers, Admins, and, in the future, Parents. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, current features, and planned enhancements.
Architecture

Frontend
    • Framework: React.js
    • Styling: Bootstrap
    • Purpose: The frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user interface for interacting with the system.

Backend
    • Framework: Express.js
    • Purpose: The backend handles routing, business logic, and database interactions.

Database
    • Type: MongoDB
    • Purpose: The database stores all the data related to users, courses, attendance, grades, etc.

Directory Structure
The application is organized into several key directories:
    1. Routes Directory:
        ◦ Contains all route definitions for handling client requests.
        ◦ Routes are divided based on user roles and functionalities.
    2. Controllers Directory:
        ◦ Receives and processes POST requests from the frontend.
        ◦ Implements business logic and interacts with the models to fetch or update data.
    3. Models Directory:
        ◦ Defines the schemas for the data tables in MongoDB.
        ◦ Each model corresponds to a different entity in the system (e.g., User, Class, Subject).
    4. Index File:
        ◦ The entry point of the application.
        ◦ Initializes the server and connects to the database.
